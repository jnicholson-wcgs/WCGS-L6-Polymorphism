# WCGS-L6-Polymorphism
C# Coding Examples with polymorphism

Task 1:

Define a new class called rectangle which is derived from the class shape
Add two instances of rectangles to the list of shapes (using shapes.Add()

Task 2

Define a new class called square which is derived from rectangle. 
This is a special case of a rectangle, including a class specific area() method to calculate it's area
Add a constructor which takes a single dimension for the length of the side of the square.
Add two instances of squares and add them to the list of shapes.

Task 3

Modify the circle class so that it it extend the getName() shape method.
It must call the base class getName() and add to string describing the radius of the circle. e.g., "Circle r3.4"

Task 4

Process the lists of shapes in main() to call the area() method for each shape.
Determine why the area method for specific shapess is not drawn - you will need to reseach
overriding and abstract classes.
